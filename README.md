# Customer-Segmentation
In this project, we dive into the realm of customer segmentation through clustering techniques. Using a dataset containing customer data and their interactions with a business, our objective is to group customers based on similarities in their behavior, preferences, or characteristics.

By leveraging clustering algorithms, we aim to uncover valuable insights that can inform marketing strategies, product recommendations, and customer engagement.
